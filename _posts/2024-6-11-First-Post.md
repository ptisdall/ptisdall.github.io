title: The Purpose of this Blog
---

Right, so the point of this blog is for me to have a place to jot down all of the things I have learned in my short (but eventful) career as a Spacecraft AIT Engineer. Since 2018 I have been working in the European space sector for various companies, building, testing, and flying spacecraft. I have lived in 4 countries in that time, and travelled to many more. I have had the pleasure of working on quite a few spacecraft, some of which have already gone to space, and some are still waiting.

I have worked on propulsion sub-systems, thermal systems, electrical and avionics systems, structural components, and been a part of all of the testing required to bring a spacecraft from first bolts up to launch and early flight operations. Hopefully in that time I have picked up enough things to make this worthwhile.
